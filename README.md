# Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification

This project demonstrates how to create a Neural Network model for image classification.

The data set is composed of photos of dogs and cats extracted from Kaggle. Some 8,000 images are used for model training and 2,000 for validation.

The learning curves indicate an accuracy of 75%, which is very good considering that the model was only trained for 10 epochs. We can see that the model is capable of further learning, repeating the experiment with 100 or more epochs will most likely result in a better performing model.
